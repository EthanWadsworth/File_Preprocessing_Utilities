Sonnet 18: shall I compar thee summer’ day?
bi william shakespeare

shal I compar thee summer’ day?
thou art love temperate:
rough wind shake darl bud may,
and summer’ leas hath short date;
sometim hot eye heaven shines,
and often gold complexion dimm'd;
and everi fair fair sometim declines,
bi chanc nature’ chang cours untrimm'd;
but thi etern summer shall fade,
nor lose possess fair thou ow’st;
nor shall death brag thou wander’st shade,
when etern line time thou grow’st:
so long men breath eye see,
so long live this, give life thee.
