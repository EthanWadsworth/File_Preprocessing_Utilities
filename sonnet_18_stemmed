Sonnet 18: shall I compar thee to a summer’ day?
bi william shakespeare

shal I compar thee to a summer’ day?
thou art more love and more temperate:
rough wind do shake the darl bud of may,
and summer’ leas hath all too short a date;
sometim too hot the eye of heaven shines,
and often is hi gold complexion dimm'd;
and everi fair from fair sometim declines,
bi chanc or nature’ chang cours untrimm'd;
but thi etern summer shall not fade,
nor lose possess of that fair thou ow’st;
nor shall death brag thou wander’st in hi shade,
when in etern line to time thou grow’st:
so long as men can breath or eye can see,
so long live this, and thi give life to thee.
