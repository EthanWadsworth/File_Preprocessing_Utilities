Sonnet 18: Shall I compare thee summer’s day?
BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE

Shall I compare thee summer’s day?
Thou art lovely temperate:
Rough winds shake darling buds May,
And summer’s lease hath short date;
Sometime hot eye heaven shines,
And often gold complexion dimm'd;
And every fair fair sometime declines,
By chance nature’s changing course untrimm'd;
But thy eternal summer shall fade,
Nor lose possession fair thou ow’st;
Nor shall death brag thou wander’st shade,
When eternal lines time thou grow’st:
So long men breathe eyes see,
So long lives this, gives life thee.
